Once there was man named jason, he was recruited by a local tribe to 
help supliment the defences of their main base. The man slayed. He 
grinded metal, flint, stone, wood and good tames.

One day, Jason was summoned to the local council meeting to discuss an important matter. The safety
of the tribe was at stake. The tribe leader had been informed that an outside barbarian tribe from
the north would be invading in less than half a day, and Jason needed to organize an army to defend
them. What will Jason's strategy be?
