Once there was man named jason, he was recruited by a local tribe to 
help supliment the defences of their main base. The man slayed. He 
grinded metal, flint, stone, wood and good tames.

One day, Jason was summoned to the local council meeting to discuss an important matter. The safety
of the tribe was at stake. The tribe leader had been informed that an outside barbarian tribe from
the north would be invading in less than half a day, and Jason needed to organize an army to defend
them. What will Jason's strategy be?

Jason recruited every single able bodied person in the tribe to help fight 
the barbarians. The tribe worked all day making weapons so that the tribe 
stand a fighting chance. The scouts blew the horn signaling that the barbarians
were approaching. The fight was about to begin.

Tribe had more superior weapons than babarians.
Finaly the tribe won.

Jason's valient effort allowed for a revenge attack shortly after. In the revenge 
attack Jason's tribe was successful in foundation wiping the former attackers. He blew 
through the vaults and the spoils of war were for his taking. Jason had his first 
taste of a sucessful raid and was hungry for more....
